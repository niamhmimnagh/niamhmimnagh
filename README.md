## 🎓 Postdoctoral Researcher | Data Scientist | Statistician

📍 Specialising in predictive modelling, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning applied to agriculture, ecology, and animal health.

🔬 My research focuses on:

 * Disease Prediction: Building models to predict and mitigate outbreaks in livestock, with a focus on diseases like BVD.
 * Machine Learning: Developing advanced classifiers, anomaly detectors, and survival analysis methods for imbalanced datasets.
 * Bayesian Methods: Extending hierarchical models for population estimation and disease monitoring.
    
🛠️ Passionate about creating accessible tools for researchers, including R packages for statistical modelling and data visualisation.

📊 Stats blogger <a href="https://simplifyingstats.wordpress.com/">@Simplifying Statistics</a>, making complex statistical concepts easy to understand, and sharing some of my current projects.

💡 Projects:

  * Multi-stage BVD prediction models.
  * R package development (e.g., multi-species N-mixture models).
  * Digitising and exploring historical data (e.g., the 1854 cholera map, Minard's map of Napoleon's march).
    
🌱 Always learning and exploring new ways to apply statistics to real-world problems.
